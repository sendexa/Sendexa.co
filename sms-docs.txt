SMS Statuses
Kindly find below for SMS Status based on DeliveryReceipts (DLR)s by Telco.

Delivered: These messages have been reliably and successfully dispatched to the recipient's phone. This constitutes the ultimate Delivery Receipt (DLR) status provided by a telco.
Sent: Sent messages encompass messages that have been forwarded by Hubtel to the recipient's network operator for eventual delivery. These messages are currently in a state of pending delivery by the telcos. To ascertain their ultimate status, you can utilize the status check API at a later time.
Pending: Pending messages are those in a queue, awaiting discharge by Hubtel to the recipient's network operator for the purpose of delivery.
Blacklisted: Blacklisted numbers correspond to individuals who have explicitly communicated with telcos to abstain from receiving unsolicited bulk messages on their mobile devices. As a result, the telco designates these numbers for blacklist inclusion. It's important to emphasize that the network operator is responsible for delivering messages to the handset. Hubtel solely receives the ultimate message status from the mobile network operator.
Undeliverable/Failed, Unrouteable/Error, Rejected: Occurrences of messages like these could arise from various factors, such as the customer's phone being powered off, inaccessible, or experiencing network unavailability. Additionally, issues could stem from the recipient being situated outside network coverage during the moment the message was dispatched to their device. These various statuses are dependent on the various Telcos.
NACK/0x0000000b/Invalid Destination Address: These statuses mean that the recipient number may be inaccurate or inadequately formatted.
NACK/0x0000000a/Invalid Source Address: These statuses mean that the value for the “From” key in your request may have exceeded the maximum limit of 11.
